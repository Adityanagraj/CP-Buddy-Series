# CP-Buddy-Series

## Introduction

Do you want to start learning #DSA?
Or Have you started and left in between due to a lack of motivation?
Or Are you already learning but is there no one to whom you can discuss?
Do you want to be the part of the community where all have the same interest?

Then we at Brainless Coders bring to you our new #CPBuddySeries. This will not be a typical video lecture series because there are already lots of resources available.

We will #practice and practice daily.
Not only that be the part of the community where you can discuss anything about #competitiveprogramming (of course not the answer of a live contest ðŸ˜‰) and this all craziness will go on for 3 months.
